## Description:
SweetSpot helps remove the daily diabetic cycle burden of keeping track of insulin dosages and doing the complex math of insulin dosage calculations for you. Once you enter your blood glucose reading and your carb intake sweet spot does all the complicated calculations using your preset factors determined by you and your doctor. It takes any previous log data, producing an insulin dosage amount that is much more accurate and faster than doing it yourself.

## Requirements:
The app needs to accurately calculate and display the <strong><i>amount of insulin</i></strong> needed to take at any given time. It should refer to stored data (history log), take in new data (blood glucose, timestamp, datestamp, carbs), <strong><i>calculate amount of insulin</i></strong> (bolus) based on previous and new data, and store / write data. The prototype needs to connect to a firebase database.
