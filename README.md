## Project Synopsis:
Type 1 diabetes is a 24-7 balancing act between food, life events, and your blood sugar. Being able to accurately calculate and display the right amount of insulin one must administer at any given time is a complicated and cumbersome process often susceptible to human error. Sweet Spot takes the burden away by streamlining the process and doing the calculations for you based on current blood glucose readings, carb intake, data from previous entries and personalized physician guidelines. It makes living with type 1 diabetes a little bit sweeter.
